<h1>Smooth Jazz</h1>
<p>When playing a slow solo, you can start off by playing the melody and chords softly as written on sheet music. In addition, you can also play a bass note (or another chord tone) while comping or playing arpeggios on right hand. When your solo is coming to an end, it's a good idea to simplify the melody so that it can fade away into the chorus. This style of jazz doesn't differ much depending on whether you are playing alone or with a combo, since either way the solo is going to remain slow and pensive. Regardless of whether a bass is playing or not, you don't need to focus on maintaining a rhytmn using a bassline because slow solos generally shouldn't sound busy. Finally, slower solos are often the best for playing complicated or jazzy chords, since they won't get lost in otherwise muddy sounds like a fast left hand or complicated melodies. In fact, when playing slow solos you can often ignore the song's melody and just focus on the sounds of different chords.</p>
