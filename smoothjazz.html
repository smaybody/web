<h1>Smooth Jazz</h1>
<p>When playing a slow solo, you can start off by playing the melody and chords softly as written on sheet music. In addition, you can also play a bass note (or another chord tone) while comping or playing arpeggios on right hand. When your solo is coming to an end, it's a good idea to simplify the melody so that it can fade away into the chorus.</p>
