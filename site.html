<h1>Jazz piano solo styles</h1>
<p>This page will teach you a bit about different ways to solo when playing jazz piano, taking into account the mood each style conveys and how well they sound relative to one another. Hopefully, reading this page will provide you with some insight into how you might want to approach soloing. Take note that while some of these techniques can easily be used alongside one another to produce unique rhytmns, it would likely be difficult to smoothly transition between very different styles such as montuno and charleston. That being said, it's a wonderful idea to mix different jazz styles into your solos so long as you know your limits.
  In addition to this, the way you play your solo should differ based on whether you are soloing with a band or playing on your own. If you are part of a group, it is important that you stick to the same tempo and chord progressions as the rest of the band. A bass player will likely still play a bassline as you solo, so there's no need to focus on playing one. Instead, you can try paying more attention to the melody--for example, you could start off the solo with variations of chord tones or inversions of the song's chords before incorporating more sophisticated or jazzy sounds like ninths, augmented or diminished chords, and accidentals. On the other hand, if you are playing on your own feel free to play rubato (speed up and slow down whenever you feel like it--this is especially effective when tempo changes accompany changes in dynamics) and experiment with the chords you use.</p>
