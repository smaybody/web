<h1>Latin Jazz</h1>
<p>When playing latin jazz, it's generally suggested that you solo in a similar style as the original piece in order to maintain its rhythm and general feeling. However, when playing with a group, it could also be a good idea to spice things up using a variation in style. Some useful soloing techniques include samba, bossa nova, and montuno. While all three of these have distinct basslines and by extension rhythms, you can play montuno with a bossa nova bassline for a more relaxed feel than what you would get otherwise. Bossa nova is likely the easiest of these styles to play; you play alternating firsts and fifths following a simple pattern. Increasingly complicated is samba, which follows a similar left hand but also incorporates comping into the right hand. Finally, the hardest of these three techniques is montuno, in which you can play a variety of basslines accompanied by its own specific pattern for right hand. While not especially difficult for practiced musicians, montuno sounds relatively complex.</p>
