<h1>Latin Jazz</h1>
<p>When playing latin jazz, it's generally suggested that you solo in a similar style to maintain the rhythm and style of the original piece. Some useful soloing techniques include samba, bossa nova, and montuno. While all three of these styles have distinct basslines, you can play montuno with a bossa nova bassline for a more relaxed feel than what you would get otherwise.</p>
