<h1>Fast American Jazz</h1>
<p>When soloing to a relatively upbeat or exciting song, faster styles work well in maintaining the same energy as the rest of the song, rather than abruptly slowing down or becoming melancholy. When playing a solo in situations like these, it's a good idea to use walking bass, charleston, or stride. These styles all sound quite different from one another, and you can try to use multiple in one solo as well. You can play a walking bass by connecting the bass notes of each chord in a low register, playing a steady rhythmn. Charleston can be played by simply repeating a pattern on left hand while comping, and stride is the most difficult of the three styles: you have to play the melody on right hand while moving between registers with your left hand, playing the first and fifth chord tones in a low register and the third and seventh an octave or two higher (think of old ragtime music like the Entertainer). While generally a fast style, stride can also sound nice if played slowly and with the right dynamics--it shouldn't be loud unless your goal is to annoy the audience.</p>
