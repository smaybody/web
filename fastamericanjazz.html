<h1>Fast American Jazz</h1>
<p>When soloing to a relatively upbeat or exciting song, faster styles work well in maintaining the same energy as the rest of the song, rather than abruptly slowing down or becoming melancholy. When playinh a solo in situations like these, it's a good idea to use walking bass, charleston, or stride. These styles all sound quite different from one another, and you can try to use multiple in one solo as well. In addition, stride can also sound nice if played slowly and with the right dynamics--it shouldn't be loud unless your goal is to annoy the audience.</p>
